# Introduction

Welcome to the BDNA Data Platform API!

BDNA Data Platform APIs are designed to adhere to the REST principles. Our APIs are designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. JSON will be returned in all responses from the API.

BDNA Data Platform APIs provide easy interface to access Technopedia Catalog and Content, and Normalize data. These APIs provide full CRUD functionality on Technopedia Catalog and Content and Retrieve functionality on Normalize data.

This version of Data Platform APIs also provide Private Catalog functionality where users can create, update and delete private content to Technopedia.
