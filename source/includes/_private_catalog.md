# Private Catalog

Private Catalog is a new feature in BDNA Data Platform v5.0. With Private Catalog, the user can

1. Update Technopedia public data with custom data. For example, update the price of software
2. Create and manage privately-defined catalog objects
3. Create and track applications that you have developed internally

APIs facilitate the creation of private catalog data.
