# OData
Technopedia APIs are based on OData (Open Data Protocol).

OData is a data access protocol for the web. It is an OASIS standard that defines the best practice for building and consuming RESTful APIs. It provides a uniform way to query and manipulate data sets.

OData RESTful APIs are easy to consume. BDNA Data Platform APIs support Version 4 of the OData protocol.

The OData metadata, a machine-readable description of the data model of the APIs, enables the creation of powerful generic client proxies and tools. 

Please refer to <a href='http://www.odata.org/libraries/'>http://www.odata.org/libraries/</a> for a list of OData libraries available to implement Client applications in .NET, Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, and other platforms.
